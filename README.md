# hello-world
good start
Hi everyone,
I am a formulation chemist dealing with removal of polymer materials in semiconductor industry.
I am curious about computer programming but I have a fear about coding. I do not know if I can
learn how to code. I only leanred a little bit C back in college. Hopefully I can overcome my fear 
by joining the group of very talented computer programmers and have a good start from here today.
